# GitHubInterface

Description

Welcome fellow developers, in this repo I created a button so that you can create Issues to your Github repo through your UI. This is done when you
click the create issue button and a text field will display. Once you fill in the text field with the help of AJAX it will send the data to your 
Github repo and create the issue you submitted into you repo issues.
